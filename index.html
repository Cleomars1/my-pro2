        <p1> Including vegetables as part of a healthy eating pattern can reduce the risk of some chronic diseases,
            including heart disease and type 2 diabetes, as well stroke and cancer. USDA's MyPlate includes all
            vegetables and 100% vegetable juice in this group. Vegetables can be raw or cooked, and they can be
            fresh,
            frozen, canned or dehydrated. This offers a wide variety of options for meeting daily and weekly intake
            recommendations.</p1>

        <p2>MyPlate divides vegetables into the following subgroups: dark-green vegetables, starchy vegetables, red
            and
            orange vegetables, beans and peas, and other vegetables. Foods from every subgroup do not have to be
            consumed daily; instead, they can be incorporated into a weekly eating pattern for optimal health.</p2>
        <h2>Essential Nutrients in Vegetables</h2>
        <p3> Vegetables are an important part of a healthy eating pattern and are excellent sources of many
            nutrients,
            including potassium, fiber, folate (folic acid) and vitamins A, E and C. These nutrients are vital for
        </p3>
        overall health and maintenance of body systems:

        Potassium: This nutrient may help to maintain healthy blood pressure. A few sources of potassium include
        sweet potatoes, white potatoes, tomato products and spinach.
        Fiber: Fiber regulates bowel function, helps reduce blood cholesterol levels and may lower risk of heart
        disease.
        Folate (folic acid): The body uses folate to form healthy red blood cells. Women of childbearing age who may
        become pregnant and those in the first trimester of pregnancy need adequate folate to reduce the risk of
        neural tube defects such as spina bifida during fetal development.
